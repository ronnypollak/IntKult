\newglossaryentry{Attribute}
{
name={Attribute},
description={An attribute is a property or characteristic of a class that describes some aspect of the objects it represents}
}

\newglossaryentry{Association}
{
name={Association},
description={An association is a relationship between two classes that indicates that one class is related to or connected to another in some way}
}

\newglossaryentry{Aggregation}
{
name={Aggregation},
description={Aggregation is a special type of association that represents a whole-part relationship between two classes. The whole class is the parent class, and the part class is the child class}
}

\newglossaryentry{Composition}
{
name={Composition},
description={Composition is a special type of aggregation that represents a strong whole-part relationship between two classes. The part class cannot exist without the whole class}
}

\newglossaryentry{Dependency}
{
name={Dependency},
description={A dependency is a relationship between two classes that indicates that one class depends on the other in some way}
}

\newglossaryentry{Generalization}
{
name={Generalization},
description={Generalization is a relationship between two classes that indicates that one class is a more general or abstract version of the other class}
}

\newglossaryentry{Inheritance}
{
name={Inheritance},
description={Inheritance is a relationship between two classes that indicates that one class is a subclass of another class, and therefore inherits its attributes, operations, and associations}
}

\newglossaryentry{Interface}
{
name={Interface},
description={An interface is a type of model element that defines a set of operations that a class can implement}
}

\newglossaryentry{Operation}
{
name={Operation},
description={An operation is a function or method that can be performed by a class or one of its objects}
}

\newglossaryentry{Realization}
{
name={Realization},
description={Realization is a relationship between two sets of model elements, where one set represents a specification and the other set represents an implementation of that specification}
}

\newglossaryentry{Specialization}
{
name={Specialization},
description={Specialization is the reverse of generalization, and represents a relationship between two classes where one class is a more specific version of the other class}
}

\newglossaryentry{Substitution dependency}
{
name={Substitution dependency},
description={A substitution dependency is a relationship between two classifiers (such as classes, components, or use cases) that indicates that one classifier (the client) can be used in place of another classifier (the supplier) at runtime}
}

\newglossaryentry{Usage}{
    name={Usage},
    description={A usage dependency is a relationship between two classifiers (such as classes, components, or use cases) that indicates that one classifier (the client) uses the services of another classifier (the supplier) at runtime.}
}

\newglossaryentry{Abstraction}{
    name={Abstraction},
    description={Abstraction is a relationship between two classifiers (such as classes, components, or use cases) that represents the idea that one classifier represents a simplified view of the other classifier, and therefore can be used in place of it.}
